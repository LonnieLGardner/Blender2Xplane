# Blender2Xplane
This is for "importing" X-Plane obj format into Blender. The name of the plugin is reversed because there is an "<a href="https://github.com/X-Plane/XPlane2Blender">Xplane2Blender</a>" addon already that exports from Blender to X-Plane obj format. This might take awhile because this has been asked for a number of years now and I guess no one wants to tackle it because of the many issues involved. So I like a challenge and for my first repository here on GrubHub I'll give it a shot.
